\section{Hybrid logic}

\subsection{Arthur Prior and hybrid logic}

Prior~\cite{Prior1967} objected Reichenbach's ideas about the point of
reference. This is ironic, as Areces and Blackburn pointed 
out~\cite{ArecesBlackburn2005} since in that same book~\cite{Prior1967}, Prior introduced
a tool that allows integrating his own ideas with those of Reichenbach in a
very simple way.

This tool's key idea is to add a second sort of propositional symbols ($i$, $%
j$, $k$, etc.), called nominals, to the propositional symbols of orthodox
tense logic ($p$, $q$, $r$, etc.). Nominals allow to formally ``talk'' about
time because each nominal symbol is only true at exactly one time in any
model; the time the nominal \emph{``is naming''}. Nominals will be the central
element of \emph{modern hybrid logic}. This is a simple change, but it
immediately produces a more expressive logic, named here \emph{nominal tense
logic}~\cite{Blackburn1994}. Let's see what this means.

Consider the formula of orthodox tense logic
$$
F(r\wedge p)\wedge \ F(r\wedge q)\rightarrow F(p\wedge q)
$$
expressing that if in the future there is a time where both $r$ and $p$ are
true together, and in the future there is a time where $r$ and $q$ are true
together, then there is a time in the future where $p$ and $q$ are true
together. It is clearly not always true because the future times that
witness $p$ and $q$ could be different. Now consider the formula of nominal
tense logic obtained by replacing the propositional symbol $r$ by the nominal
symbol $i$ 
$$
F(i\wedge p)\wedge F(i\wedge q)\rightarrow F(p\wedge q)
$$
This formula is true in every model because the future times witnessing $p$
and witnessing $q$ are both making the nominal $i$ true, and there is only
one time doing this for $i$, by definition. Thus, there is a future time
where $p$ and $q$ are both true, something expressible in nominal tense
logic.

Therefore, nominals introduced by Prior allow to express Reichenbach's
points of reference. Moreover, representations in nominal tense improve
Reichenbach's representations~\cite{ArecesBlackburn2005}. As an example,
consider the formula $P(i\wedge P\varphi )$ stating that there is some time
in the past, named with the nominal $i$, and that the event $\varphi $
happened before that past time. It is the representation of the pluperfect
modelization of Reichenbach and combines Reichenbach's insight on the role
played by temporal reference with Prior's insistence on the privileged role
of tensed talk. Figure 2 shows a modification of the table given earlier,
obtained by adding nominal for tense logical representations. In some cases
the nominal tense logical representations improve Reichenbach's. For
instance, the future-in-the-past now has a single representation: the
formula $P(i\wedge F\varphi )$ expresses that there is a reference time $i$
in the past, and that the point of event occurs to the future of $i$, which
is what the future-in-the-past means. With this representation, it is not
necessary to use irrelevant different positions of the point of reference
with respect to the point of speech, as Reichenbach did.

\end{figure}

In nominal tense logic we can find the following characteristic elements of
hybrid modern logic:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Nominals}. Prior invented a representation for referring to
instants of time: \emph{sorting the propositional symbols and using terms
as formulas} 
$$
\ATOM \cup \NOM
$$
The atomic formulas $i\in \NOM$ received the expected
interpretation, just a singleton.

\item \textbf{Universal modality}. The diamond form of the universal
modality is $\mathbf{E}$

\item \textbf{Quantifiers}. Prior added the quantifiers $\forall$ and 
$\exists$ allowing then to bind nominals
\end{itemize}

This is neat. However, as we pointed out at the start of the paper, the
discussion has been conducted within the confines of propositional nominal
tense logic. If we want to apply these ideas to real grammars for natural
language, that is not good enough. And this leads us to the main topic of
the paper: adding nominals to Montague's IL.

\subsection{Hybrid versus modal}

Modal logic is ironic, because \emph{states}
are crucial but we cannot refer to them with the formal logic. However, in
an hybrid logic \emph{yes we can\textexclamdown }. In fact in hybrid logic
we enhance expressivity of modal logic:

\begin{itemize}
\item To introduce explicit references to the elements of the model domain;
for instance, states, days, years, etc.

\item To express that two elements of the domain are related; \emph{i. e.}
a moment precedes another

\item To improve expressive power by modelling time indexicals; as an
example, yesterday, today, tomorrow, now, etc.

\item To have very elegant proof theory, closed to labelled deduction systems

\item To define properties of frames which are relevant to temporal logic
(irreflexivity, asymmetry)
\end{itemize}

Hybrid logic analyses the upsides and downsides of modal formalisms in
depth, building on modal simplicity whilst adding nominals and the $@$
operator to improve its expressive power. It was Patrick Blackburn's idea.
Nominals refer to individual nodes in the Kripke structure and the $@$
operator allows us to state in the object language that a formula is true at
a given point, while the accessibility relation becomes explicit.

\subsection{The @ operator}

As already noted, in a hybrid language we have two sorts of atomic formulas;
namely $\ATOM \cup \NOM$. We add a new set of modal
operators $\{ @_{i}\mid i\in \NOM\}$ and we form new
formulas in this extended language: $\NOM \subseteq \FORM$ 
and $@_{i}\varphi \in \FORM$ for each $i\in \NOM$.

In the hybrid semantic we still have Kripke models and we add interpretation
of new formulas. The semantics expels the intuition 
$$
\mathcal{A},w\Vdash i~\ \text{iff\ }~\text{the instant }w\text{ is named\ }i%
\text{ iff \ }i^{\mathcal{A}}=\left\{ w\right\}
$$
while the interpretation of the new operator $@$ reads%
$$
\mathcal{A},w\Vdash @_{i}\varphi ~\ \text{iff\ }~\mathcal{A},v\Vdash \varphi
$$
$v$ being the unique element of $W$ where $i$ is true, namely 
$i^{\mathcal{A}}=\{v\}$.

\subsection{Zen Philosophy}

As an example of the expressive power of hybrid logic let us see the
following.

In \emph{The book of perfect emptiness} Tang de Ying asked Xia Ge: 
\emph{``Did things exist at the dawn of time?''}.

Xia Ge answered: \emph{``If things had not existed at the
dawn of time, how could they possibly exist today? By the same token, men in
the future could believe that things did not exist today.''}

This argument can be reformulated in this way.

\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha :=\;$\emph{If things exist at a given point in time, then at
any given previous moment in time things must have existed.}

\item $\beta :=\;$\emph{Things exist today.}

\item $\gamma :=\;$\emph{The dawn of time is previous to all else.}

\item $\delta :=\;$\emph{Things existed at the dawn of time.}
\end{itemize}

In hybrid temporal logic we can express this argument quite simply:

Hypothesis:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha :=q\rightarrow [P] q$

\item $\beta :=@_{h}\ q$

\item $\gamma :=@_{a}[P] \perp$
\end{itemize}

Conclusion

\begin{itemize}
\item $\delta :=@_{a}\ q$
\end{itemize}

To prove $\delta $ from the hypothesis we can use the trichotomy axiom of
temporal logic 
$$
@_{a}\ h\vee @_{a}\ \left\langle P\right\rangle h\vee @_{h}\ \left\langle
P\right\rangle a
$$

\subsection{Expressivity enhanced}

\emph{Reflexivity}, \emph{symmetry} and \emph{transitivity} of identity are
now pure formulas:%
$$
@_{i}i\qquad @_{i}j\rightarrow @_{j}i\qquad @_{i}j\wedge @_{j}k\rightarrow
@_{i}k
$$
And we can also express that two points are accessible: $@_{s}\Diamond t\ $%
says that states named by $s\ $and\ $t$ are related by accessibility\ $R$

\emph{Reflexivity}, \emph{symmetry} and \emph{transitivity} of accessibility
are pure formulas as well:%
$$
@_{i}\Diamond i\qquad @_{i}\square \Diamond i\qquad \Diamond \Diamond
i\rightarrow \Diamond i
$$

\emph{Irreflexivity}, \emph{asymmetry}, \emph{antisymmetry} and\emph{\
intransitivity} of accessibility are also pure formulas: 
$$
@_{i}\lnot \Diamond i\qquad @_{i}\lnot \Diamond \Diamond i\qquad
@_{i}\square (\Diamond i\rightarrow i)\qquad \Diamond \Diamond i\rightarrow
\lnot \Diamond i
$$
